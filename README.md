Grant Proposals Management
===============

There are many calls for "Research Grants" to which university staff may apply to acquire research funding. For example, the "Commerce Research Grant" is usually advertised in the beginning of each semester of the year. As of today, the applications for these grants are submitted and evaluated using an old-fashioned and manual process (i.e., excel sheets). Your task is to think of a system that can manage the submission and evaluation of Grant Proposals.
